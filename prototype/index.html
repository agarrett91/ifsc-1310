        <h2>From Humble Beginnings</h2>
        <p> So, the story goes a bit like this... When I was a child I vaguely remember taking a trip to Big Bear in California, about two hours away from my house in San Diego,
            and while there, I remember seeing this green car that I didn't recognize, mind you I was maybe 5 at the time so there's a lot of fuzzy details. Long story short,
            my father bought at 1969 Chevy Camaro for my sister as a technical project for her to work on. The idea was that my father and her were going to work on it together,
            to teach her how to fix an engine and rebuild a classic. That ended up not happening and the car sat dormant in San Diego at my father's residence for several years.
            Fast forward to the time I'm about 13... maybe 14? I start to get interest in cars, and what better starter car than a classic Camaro, right? What I thought would be
            an easy sell to my parents turned out to be a <strong>LOT</strong> harder than I had expected. I didn't realize that ego was a thing, and of course, being a teenager
            with a classic car is a recipe for disaster. Every dumb punk in high school is gonna want to race it, and while I thought I could keep my ego in check, my parents knew
            better... Good for my health, bad for my ego. A few years go by and I ask my old man sometimes in the spring "Hey, what if we work on the interior of the car in the 
            summer?" Mostly for some kind of project that he and I can work on together since my sister had long since moved on. He agrees, and we order parts from <a href="https://www.classicindustries.com/" target="_blank">Classic Industries</a>. </p>

            <h2>The Green Interior Restoration</h2>
            <p>
                So Dad and I drive up to the Classic Industries showroom in Huntington Beach, just south of Los Angeles, couple hours up the road from us as a part of our trip.
                I really wanted to take the Camaro up there but my father said that it wouldn't make the trip and back, so we took our daily driver and got there right as the place opened. 
                Sure enough to my envy a couple of old-timers brought some classic of their own to the shop, and my mind went to "Man, I hope one day I can make my Camaro look this good."
