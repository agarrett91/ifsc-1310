        <h2>From Humble Beginnings</h2>

        <p>I also have a TL;DR if you don't feel like reading all of this. It's a good bit of text, you can find that <a href="#TLDR">here</a>, it'll take you to the bottom of the page.</p>

        <p> So, the story goes a bit like this... When I was a child I vaguely remember taking a trip to Big Bear in California, about two hours away from my house in San Diego,
            and while there, I remember seeing this green car that I didn't recognize, mind you I was maybe 5 at the time so there's a lot of fuzzy details. Long story short,
            my father bought at 1969 Chevy Camaro for my sister as a technical project for her to work on. The idea was that my father and her were going to work on it together,
            to teach her how to fix an engine and rebuild a classic. That ended up not happening and the car sat dormant in San Diego at my father's residence for several years.
            Fast forward to the time I'm about 13... maybe 14? I start to get interest in cars, and what better starter car than a classic Camaro, right? What I thought would be
            an easy sell to my parents turned out to be a <strong>LOT</strong> harder than I had expected. I didn't realize that ego was a thing, and of course, being a teenager
            with a classic car is a recipe for disaster. Every dumb punk in high school is gonna want to race it, and while I thought I could keep my ego in check, my parents knew
            better... Good for my health, bad for my ego. A few years go by and I ask my old man sometimes in the spring "Hey, what if we work on the interior of the car in the 
            summer?" Mostly for some kind of project that he and I can work on together since my sister had long since moved on. He agrees, and we order parts from <a href="https://www.classicindustries.com/" target="_blank">Classic Industries</a>. </p>

            <h2>The Green Interior Restoration</h2>
            <p>
                So Dad and I drive up to the Classic Industries showroom in Huntington Beach, just south of Los Angeles, couple hours up the road from us as a part of our trip.
                I really wanted to take the Camaro up there but my father said that it wouldn't make the trip and back, so we took our daily driver and got there right as the place opened. 
                Sure enough to my envy a couple of old-timers brought some classic of their own to the shop, and my mind went to "Man, I hope one day I can make my Camaro look this good."
                We go into the store, pick up our parts and head back and of course I'm eager as hell to start the project, it's a week long endeavour with my father since he has me that week
                (side note, parents were divorced at the time for the clarification). The problem is that as I typed this out, I realized I don't really remember much about the project itself.
                I remember we had to leave the leather seat covers in the sun so they could stretch, and I remember installing the foot plates in the door... and giving the metal under the rug a whole bunch of
                unnecessary paint... But that's basically it. Okay so that story wasn't as good as I thought. Anyways, moving on...</p>

            <h2>The Drive</h2>
            <p>
                Fast forward to about 2014. I'm a little over two years into my career in the Air Force, just under halfway through. I'm not gonna bore you with the details of where I was, but to make
                a long story short, I ask my Dad "Hey, whatever happened to that Camaro? You get around to selling it or no?" to which he replies "Nope, haven't sold it. It's technically your sister's...
                Why? What are you thinking?" I say to him "You think I can have it? I'm making some money now, government is paying me, maybe I can fix it up." At this point there was a bit of an awkward
                silence, I was almost concerned that I dropped the call since I was kind of out in the middle of nowhere. My Dad says "You know what? That's not a bad idea. Under one condition, you never street race it"
                "Done" I said quickly. "You know that's how your cousin died right? Your mom would kill me if I didn't make that a stipulation" He says. "Yeah... I remember that. I can keep that promise" I say back to him.
                Some further details got hashed out on the call, but the plan was to take some leave, fly out to California on a one-way trip and bring the Camaro back to Arkansas on a cross country trip. It takes my Dad
                a few weeks to prep the car for the journey, it hadn't run in years. When I get there, I spend a day with both of my parents, catching up, the usual. The next morning Dad has a whole bunch of snacks packed
                and tools ready in case anything happens. We set off from his house.... <em>AND NOT EVEN 5 MILES IN</em>... the car starts giving us issues because of course it does. Why wouldn't it? After a few minutes of 
                tinkering, we get the car running, and it ran surprisingly well for the majority of the trip after that! Our little joke along the way was that whenever we'd see someone give us a &#128077; , we'd put our hands together
                and make a motion like something is snapping, basically saying "Nah, this thing is broke." Usually got a good laugh out of the old heads. 
            </p>

            <h3>Texas... damn Texas</h3>
            <p>
                I'm gonna go on a small tangent for a moment. My family used to drive everywhere when I was younger. Gas was cheap, flying was expensive and we didn't have a lot of money. There was always a running joke about Texas,
                something along the lines of <q>You can't make it through Texas in a single day</q> if I'm properly quoting my Mom. I always thought it was a silly joke, you just gotta power through it, right? Well, turns out
                that the Camaro has heard this joke too. We started at the crack of dawn and drove basically all day through Texas, short onramps and burnouts a plenty. We get into the outskirts of DFW right abround sunset, everything is going fine.
                Just as we get through the city center, and just getting to the outskirts, the lights drop off, pitch black. Old car, faulty electrical, bad time. We pull off to the side of the road before a Texas State Trooper decides he needs to fill a quota
                and find an auto repair store, can't remember which one. We try to fix the headlights but a fuse has popped and we don't have the energy, the time, or the light to try to fix it, even with a flashlight. We make the smart decision
                to simply call it a day and get a hotel for the night. The legend of Texas being impassable in a day lived on... at least a little while longer. Thanks Texas... Thanks you stupid car. We were gonna break it but noooooo...
            </p>
        
            <h2>The Drive, Continued</h2>
            <p>
                So we get the car into Little Rock, my father and I go our separate ways after a few days. He gets on his flight, I've got the car. The car of my childhood is finally in my possession...Only, everything is not as it seems. Yes I realize that
                was not really worthy of a continued paragraph but the Texas story was too good to pass up... Also, the next bit is kinda dark so I wanted to cap this off.
            </p>

            <h2>Driven Beyond...</h2>
            <p>
                There came a point in my life where I was, well, let's put it this way. I wouldn't be here right now were it not for some very good people to turn to. That make sense? The Camaro didn't help matters. I didn't have a reliable daily driver
                at the time. The Camaro <strong>WAS</strong> my daily, I didn't have another car to turn to. Well, one night I get to the intersection of the air base, right before the gate, and the Camaro dies. I mean it shut off right in the middle of the
                drive. No warning, just... dead. I pushed the car into the parking lot, got a ride from one of the base security guards and went in, damn near cried myself to sleep. Checked myself into mental health and told the psychologist that all the stress
                on me from that time period plus my dream car dying nearly sent me over the edge of stability. Not a great experience. Managed to get the Camaro into the parking lot at the dorms on base and it sat there... for a while. I used a bit of my down time to
                talk to my bank and get a loan for a proper daily driver, something that won't randomly fail on me in the middle of the night. So the Camaro sat untouched, for months. The daily was just so much better for my mental health anyways.
            </p>

            <h3>Downtime</h3>
            <p>
                After I got out of the Air Force the car sat in storage for a long time, I mean multiple years. Never once moved, never turned the engine over. It had an electrical problem that I couldn't fix. I've got a picture of it
                <a href="img/green-in-shed.jpg" target="_blank" title="The 69 in the shed, rather dirty">here as well</a>, at least how it looked the majority of the time.
            </p>

            <h2>The Barn Find</h2>
            <p>
                So a few months ago (as of the writing of this, mid-February timeframe) I get the brilliant idea "You know, I should see how far a personal loan gets me in restoring that old Camaro I got lying around." Sounded like a good idea, until I went to a local
                body shop and they told me "[That number] doesn't even get you started" which left me a bit unsettled. I kind of came to the realization that this car might never get done, because I don't have the money. I had thanked the owner for their time, and right as I turn
                around, I mean <b>RIGHT</b> there... was this 1968 Camaro, just chillin' in the lot of the auto shop. An SS too... absolute beauty. When I finally came to realize <a href="img/blue-barn-find.jpg" target="_blank" title="68 in the lot...">what I was looking at</a>, I had
                to ask the owner about it... well, the lot owner. He didn't own the Camaro, but he had worked on it, rebuilt it somewhat. The guy told me "The owner actually is looking to get rid of it, his wife is rather upset with him about it at the moment. He'll probably let it go for
                about what you had asked with your loan." My eyes <em>LIT. UP.</em> No way... no way this dude is gonna let a beauty go for what I want. Sure enough, as the story goes, I get in contact with him, and while it was a little more than what I was hoping in my head to pay for it,
                it was still easily within the realm of possible. I took my load, paid the man in cash, drove away with the Camaro of my wilder fantasies. Of course, it isn't a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=yenko+camaro&rlz=1CATRYO_enUS1042US1042&sxsrf=AJOqlzVTn2rzvOuKF5mC1GN5tdEOXwwfYg:1676525236205&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiYtKSZp5n9AhWenGoFHZ0RCFAQ_AUoAXoECAIQAw&biw=1920&bih=929&dpr=1" target="_blank">Yenko Camaro</a>
                (a very special road model that is coveted in muscle car circles) or some super rare version, but an SS is probably the most realistic version I could ever obtain. I'm not getting any special RS/SS or Yenko or COPO or anything, not with what little money I have. An SS is perfectly fine.
            </p>

            <h4>A Brief Description of Versions</h4>
            <dl>
            <dt>So I mentioned different variants of Camaros above, here's a quick run down of what they are</dt>
            <dd>SS - Super Sport, a small step up from the base model. There are subvariants of this as well like the 327, 350 and others (usually engine size and trim package)</dd>
            <dd>RS - Rally Sport, a step up from Super Sport. Bigger engine, more power, top of the line trim</dd>
            <dd>RS/SS - Rally Sport/Super Sport, the best of both worlds from the RS and SS packages. Expensive!</dd>
            <dd>Yenko - Custom made by racer Don Yenko. He slapped in an engine that Chevrolet wouldn't put in. Legendary on the streets. Very few of these.</dd>
            <dd>COPO - Central Office Production Order, built for one purpose, <b>Street. Dominance.</b> Sometimes they aren't even street legal! Even less of these.</dd>
                </dl>

            <p>Okay, sorry for the detour, back to the story</p>

            <h2>Getting Rid of the Green</h2>
            <p>
                So now comes the issue of the green monster... How in the <em>hell</em> do I get rid of this thing? At some point I said "Eff this" and posted an ad on Craigslist. In hindsight, I actually could've asked for more, but I thought the price
                I asked was already too high, I would've been lucky to get one, maybe two calls and I was already thinking "They're gonna kick the tires and walk out aren't they?" So I post the ad, super early in the morning at work. At the time I worked night shift and figured that around 630am
                the post will eventually be seen. At 641 I got a text, at 705 I got a call from someone else. "Well... that was fast" I said to myself. The guy who called me offered cash and was going to pick it up in a few hours. Lo and behold, he did exactly what I thought he would do. Looked at the car,
                passed on it because "something or other" reasons. I couldn't remember what but it was a garbage excuse. All the while I'm getting texts like "You still have that Camaro I'll give you [price plus extra] and pick it up today" and so many of these damn texts came in that I had to make a queue
                and tell people that they are in line. Shortly after the first set of guys left, I got a call saying "I want the car, I'll pick it up tomorrow, I'm in West Memphis and I'll pay you in cash. I don't care what condition the car is in, I want it." I had to be careful, because that's what the last guys said too.
                Couldn't trust anyone at this point. Well, the guy lived up to his word. Paid in cash, took the car, <a href="img/green-camaro-trailer.jpg" target="_blank" title="On the trailer">flat tires and all</a> <sup>(okay so the tires aren't flat in this picture, guy brought a pump to get the tires inflated, shush)</sup>. 
                At least I had a chance to give my final goodbyes to the car, a bit sentimental, but at least the <a href="img/green-camaro-farewell.jpg" target="_blank" title="It looks kinda sad eh?">picture looks kind of cool</a> so I was fine with that. Good memories... and good riddance. Yeah, see how the tires are flat on the left side?
                Told you. Also, I kept the license plates. I sent one to the owner and I am still holding on to the other, eventually I'll send it to my old man.

            </p>

            <h4>Small Details</h4>
            <p>I'm not gonna say how much a loan I took out, nor how much I made off selling the rust bucket. You don't necessarily need to know these things, but they're somewhat important for context. Back to the story
            <blockquote>“The inside of the old Camaro smelled like asphalt and desire, gasoline and dreams.” <cite>― Maggie Stiefvater, The Dream Thieves<cite></blockquote> (Can't lie, it really does)</p>

            <h2>In Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                So I've had the 68 for a few months now. It's got its quirks, and its issues, and some problems that needed fixing. I nearly killed it in the first week that I owned it because the previous owners failed to mention the coolant leak, which got the engine temp up to 251 and nearly blew a head gasket.
                I'm sure it's damaged as hell and I'll have to pull the headers off to see what kind of damage I've got... But damn is it a cool freaking car. It definitely turns heads, not in the "Ooooooh that's such a cool car" but more in the "Nice, I respect that" kind of way. Still got a long way to go on it
                though. It's got some rust in all the common spots and the engine bay needs a clean, but over all... fun little toy! Even got a chance to meet a fellow 68 owner at the David's Burgers get together that usually happens once a month. I pulled in behind the other owner on the way in, by pure happenstance.
                Ended up <a href="img/blue-and-brother-68.jpg" target="_blank" title="68 and a brother 68">parking next to him</a>, that was a nice little meetup, can't lie about that. Of course you gotta pop the hood, that's like, basically standard protocol at meets.  His was a lot cleaner than mine, and more powerful,
                but mine had more charm, probably some bias on my end but still.

            <h5>The TL;DR</h5>
            Yeah okay this story got long. Anyways, I managed to inherit a 1969 Chevy Camaro, then had to sell it, and took the money I had to buy a 1968 Camaro that had been worked on
            which saved me a lot of money and work in the long run. The "Blue Bomber" is a fun weekend car, but there's a lot of work left to be done. A good step in the right direction.
