        <h2>From Humble Beginnings</h2>

        <p>I also have a TL;DR if you don't feel like reading all of this. It's a good bit of text, you can find that <a href="#TLDR">here</a>
        </p>
        <p> So, the story goes a bit like this... When I was a child I vaguely remember taking a trip to Big Bear in California, about two hours away from my house in San Diego,
            and while there, I remember seeing this green car that I didn't recognize, mind you I was maybe 5 at the time so there's a lot of fuzzy details. Long story short,
            my father bought at 1969 Chevy Camaro for my sister as a technical project for her to work on. The idea was that my father and her were going to work on it together,
            to teach her how to fix an engine and rebuild a classic. That ended up not happening and the car sat dormant in San Diego at my father's residence for several years.
            Fast forward to the time I'm about 13... maybe 14? I start to get interest in cars, and what better starter car than a classic Camaro, right? What I thought would be
            an easy sell to my parents turned out to be a <strong>LOT</strong> harder than I had expected. I didn't realize that ego was a thing, and of course, being a teenager
            with a classic car is a recipe for disaster. Every dumb punk in high school is gonna want to race it, and while I thought I could keep my ego in check, my parents knew
            better... Good for my health, bad for my ego. A few years go by and I ask my old man sometimes in the spring "Hey, what if we work on the interior of the car in the 
            summer?" Mostly for some kind of project that he and I can work on together since my sister had long since moved on. He agrees, and we order parts from <a href="https://www.classicindustries.com/" target="_blank">Classic Industries</a>. </p>

            <h2>The Green Interior Restoration</h2>
            <p>
                So Dad and I drive up to the Classic Industries showroom in Huntington Beach, just south of Los Angeles, couple hours up the road from us as a part of our trip.
                I really wanted to take the Camaro up there but my father said that it wouldn't make the trip and back, so we took our daily driver and got there right as the place opened. 
                Sure enough to my envy a couple of old-timers brought some classic of their own to the shop, and my mind went to "Man, I hope one day I can make my Camaro look this good."
                We go into the store, pick up our parts and head back and of course I'm eager as hell to start the project, it's a week long endeavour with my father since he has me that week
                (side note, parents were divorced at the time for the clarification). The problem is that as I typed this out, I realized I don't really remember much about the project itself.
                I remember we had to leave the leather seat covers in the sun so they could stretch, and I remember installing the foot plates in the door... and giving the metal under the rug a whole bunch of
                unnecessary paint... But that's basically it. Okay so that story wasn't as good as I thought. Anyways, moving on...</p>

            <h2>The Drive</h2>
            <p>
                Fast forward to about 2014. I'm a little over two years into my career in the Air Force, just under halfway through. I'm not gonna bore you with the details of where I was, but to make
                a long story short, I ask my Dad "Hey, whatever happened to that Camaro? You get around to selling it or no?" to which he replies "Nope, haven't sold it. It's technically your sister's...
                Why? What are you thinking?" I say to him "You think I can have it? I'm making some money now, government is paying me, maybe I can fix it up." At this point there was a bit of an awkward
                silence, I was almost concerned that I dropped the call since I was kind of out in the middle of nowhere. My Dad says "You know what? That's not a bad idea. Under one condition, you never street race it"
                "Done" I said quickly. "You know that's how your cousin died right? Your mom would kill me if I didn't make that a stipulation" He says. "Yeah... I remember that. I can keep that promise" I say back to him
                Some further details got hashed out on the call, but the plan was to take some leave, fly out to California on a one-way trip and bring the Camaro back to Arkansas on a cross country trip. It takes my Dad
                a few weeks to prep the car for the journey, it hadn't run in years.
