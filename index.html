  <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enchancement</h2>
  <p>To properly elaborate thoughts on the topic, I first have to ask "What is progressive enchancement?" As <i><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement">Mozilla</a></i> describes it, "Progressive enhancement is a design philosophy that provides a baseline of essential content and functionality to as many users as possible, while delivering the best possible experience only to users of the most modern browsers that can run all the required code."
  At least to me, this sounds like the idea that you give everyone the ability to access a website with all the proper code, but only give the full experience of your site to those that are running the main browsers (Chrome, Firefox etc.). I also see it something akin to the idea of the "lowest common denominator" in that you build all of your content for everyone to access, but not everyone will get all the nice CSS or JavaScript add-ons because they aren't on the "best" browsers (maybe a Safari mobile or an IE mobile).
  A thought rattles around in my head of "Get your content out there, and if the browser can handle it, give them some fun stuff to experience like Java plug-ins and really fancy CSS, but make sure the content is acceptable." There was an interesting point of discussion at the start of the semester about what browsers get supported or are still used, which I suppose leads into the "Graceful Degradation" model/way of thinking. 
  One of the articles we've gone over in class referes to "The M&M Model" in relation to the structure of a website. The way I've been visualizing it is that of a car, or, more specifically, a classic car. To make a car run, you need it to have a working engine, a body, and a place for the driver to sit. The seat is sort of self explanatory, it's the spot for the user. The engine is kind of like the browser itself. With those two in mind, a body is all you really need to make a vehicle function. Technically you can work on just a chassic but that's akin to the webpage being blank, it needs content.
  Once you get the body fitted to the chassis and it runs, that's the website itself built. The content works, the structure is sound, you don't have any errors on the website or welds breaking on the car. Once the car runs, you can start to make it look good, put a nice coat of paint on it, restore the interior, upgrade the dashboard and the like. This is the CSS layer, making the website, or the content, look good. Finally comes the JavaScript, which I've equated in my mind to the electronics and technology of the vehicle.
  Things like a turbocharger, or an EFM (Electronic Fuel Management) System (which I have in my Camaro for the ease of startup). I mentioned this in class at one point, but the idea of bolting a turbocharger directly onto the body is a silly idea, same with trying to mount your JavaScript code directly into you HTML code. Keeping things separate, not just for the purposes of ease of access but also for cleanliness in design is paramount when designing a website, and as a developer it will save you so much time and headache if things ever have to be changed.</p>
