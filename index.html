    <h2>Dragon Revision Asseessment</h2>
    <p>So, some quick thoughts on the Dragon website V1. I was fairly certain I had the idea nailed down of how I wanted the website to look and function, admittedly I'm not a terrible creative person so I wasn't going to make the flashiest website. With that said, the ideas I threw down worked, but I knew they only worked for me, gotta be thinking about other users right? To help with this, I enlisted the help of my father (A Network Administrator of nearly 20 years) to give the site a lookover
      The advice he gave me was that the website has the right look and feel, but it was rather dark. he mentioned that the navigation bar was tough to work through (especially with his old eyes) and the contact page was very dark as well. I took those pieces of advice, lightened things up quite a bit and even added in a few extra changes, like the hover mechanic on the navigation bar turning gold as opposed to white in an attempt to mimic the color of the flames of a rocket takeoff. Little stylistic stuff like that, it alwayhs gives me a warm fuzzy feeling.
      If I had to start over I'm not really sure what I would do differently. I felt I had a pretty good basis right off the bat, but if forced, I could make something happen... I'd just be rather annoyed, but I'd get it done! I will say though, one of the key aspects I changed from v1 to v2 was the logo. In the first iteration it was a static image, but in v2 I made it as a clickable icon to take users back to the homepage since that's mostly been wired into the user's head that that is an option. The reason i didn't do it at the start
      was because it kept breaking my code for the navigation bar. I chose to leave it static in v1 to have a good basis for starting v2, and I knew I could fiddle with the logo more, I just didn't want the v1 to appear busted, I was running a bit short of time after messing with the CSS code, frustatingly trying to figure out why my site wasn't referencing that code (it had to do with the file path, always trips me up, every. single. time.) </p>
  
      <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enchancement</h2>
  <p>To properly elaborate thoughts on the topic, I first have to ask "What is progressive enchancement?" As <i><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement">Mozilla</a></i> describes it, "Progressive enhancement is a design philosophy that provides a baseline of essential content and functionality to as many users as possible, while delivering the best possible experience only to users of the most modern browsers that can run all the required code."
  At least to me, this sounds like the idea that you give everyone the ability to access a website with all the proper code, but only give the full experience of your site to those that are running the main browsers (Chrome, Firefox etc.). I also see it something akin to the idea of the "lowest common denominator" in that you build all of your content for everyone to access, but not everyone will get all the nice CSS or JavaScript add-ons because they aren't on the "best" browsers (maybe a Safari mobile or an IE mobile).
  A thought rattles around in my head of "Get your content out there, and if the browser can handle it, give them some fun stuff to experience like Java plug-ins and really fancy CSS, but make sure the content is acceptable." There was an interesting point of discussion at the start of the semester about what browsers get supported or are still used, which I suppose leads into the "Graceful Degradation" model/way of thinking. 
  One of the articles we've gone over in class referes to "The M&M Model" in relation to the structure of a website. The way I've been visualizing it is that of a car, or, more specifically, a classic car. To make a car run, you need it to have a working engine, a body, and a place for the driver to sit. The seat is sort of self explanatory, it's the spot for the user, the engine is kind of like the browser itself. With those two in mind, a body is all you really need to make a vehicle function. Technically you can work on just a chassis but that's akin to the webpage being blank, it needs content.
  Once you get the body fitted to the chassis and it runs, that's the website itself built. The content works, the structure is sound, you don't have any errors on the website or welds breaking on the car. Once the car runs, you can start to make it look good, put a nice coat of paint on it, restore the interior, upgrade the dashboard and the like. This is the CSS layer, making the website, or the content, look good. Finally comes the JavaScript, which I've equated in my mind to the electronics and technology of the vehicle.
  Things like a turbocharger, or an EFM (Electronic Fuel Management) System (which I have in my Camaro for the ease of startup). I mentioned this in class at one point, but the idea of bolting a turbocharger directly onto the body is a silly idea, same with trying to mount your JavaScript code directly into your HTML code (At least the majority of it, some stuff can live in the head but still, semantics I suppose). Keeping things separate, not just for the purposes of ease of access but also for cleanliness in design is paramount when designing a website, and as a developer it will save you so much time and headache if things ever have to be changed.</p>
