  <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enchancement</h2>
  <p>To properly elaborate thoughts on the topic, I first have to ask "What is progressive enchancement?" As <i><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement">Mozilla</a></i> describes it, "Progressive enhancement is a design philosophy that provides a baseline of essential content and functionality to as many users as possible, while delivering the best possible experience only to users of the most modern browsers that can run all the required code."
  At least to me, this sounds like the idea that you give everyone the ability to access a website with all the proper code, but only give the full experience of your site to those that are running the main browsers (Chrome, Firefox etc.). I also see it something akin to the idea of the "lowest common denominator" in that you build all of your content for everyone to access, but not everyone will get all the nice CSS or JavaScript add-ons because they aren't on the "best" browsers (maybe a Safari mobile or an IE mobile).
  A thought rattles around in my head of "Get your content out there, and if the browser can handle it, give them some fun stuff to experience like Java plug-ins and really fancy CSS, but make sure the content is acceptable." There was an interesting point of discussion at the start of the semester about what browsers get supported or are still used, which I suppose leads into the "Graceful Degradation" model/way of thinking. </p>
